This is how you can get a million dollars by solvinga a math problem
Its called the collatz conjecture, it's simple and and it starts llike this:

Take any positive integer, if its an even number divide it by two, if its odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to it.
Now continue applying the same rules to the resulting number. 
If you do this for long enough, it turns out that you will eventually reach 4, which divided by 2 is 2 and again divided by 2 is 1. now 1 is a odd number, 
so mutiply it by 3 and add 1, it becomes 4 again and this is an infinite loop.

For example take 3, its a odd number, so we multiply it by 3 and add one, we get 10, 10 becomes 5, 5 becomes 16, 16 becomes 8 , 
8 becomes 4, 2, 1 and it repeats.

Now mathematicians have tested this for about 295 quintillion, 147 quadrillion, 905 trillion, 179 billion, 352 million, 825 thousand
eight hunderd and fifty six numbers and they all end with th 4-2-1 loop.
If you can prove that all positive integers will end with the same 4-2-1 loop or if you can prove an exception to this conjecture, you can get a 
million dollars.
